A GitHub repository template for new Ansible projects.

This template gives you the basic recommended (and in some instances required) files for your new Ansible community project.

## Template structure
This template includes sample files for the following:
- [README.md](README.md) - This file. It should describe the project and list the documentation site, when available, and how to reach the project team (Matrix room, if available and Ansible forum tags). 
- [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md) - The project license. We recommend GPLv3
- [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) - The basics for contributing to your project
- [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) - (optional) How to report security issues for your project
- [CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md](CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md) - A link to the Ansible code of conduct. Do not change this.

## Contributing to this template
You can open a GitHub issue to request changes or directly open a PR for small changes or enhancements.
