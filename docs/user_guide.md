# User Guide

Welcome to the PROJECTNAME User Guide!

> If your project is not going to have a docsite (for example, if it is very simple to use), the following information should be present in your project README as in the [README template](https://github.com/ansible-community/project-template/blob/main/README.md).

> In the following sections, if the content is as simple as a few lines, put it in there, otherwise create separate files and refer to them from the sections.

## Getting started

> Describe how to get started here or refer to a separate [Getting started guide](getting_started_user.md).

## Installation

> Describe possible installation options for popular platforms here or refer to a separate [installation guide](installing.md).

## Next section

> Add as many sections as needed to cover all usage aspects.

## Communication

Need help or want to share feedback? See the [Community guide](community_guide.md)!
