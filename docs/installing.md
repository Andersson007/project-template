# Installation

Welcome to the PROJECTNAME Installation Guide!

> If your project is not going to have a docsite (for example, if it is very simple to use), the following information should be present in your project README as in the [README template](https://github.com/ansible-community/project-template/blob/main/README.md).

> Describe possible installation options for popular platforms in corresponding sections when relevant. Add relevant and remove irrelevant sections as required.
