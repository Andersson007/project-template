# Contributor Guide

Welcome to the PROJECTNAME Contributor Guide!

> If your project is not going to have a docsite (for example, if it is very simple to contribute to it), the following information should be present in your project CONTRIBUTING.md file and referred to from the [README template](https://github.com/ansible-community/project-template/blob/main/README.md).

> In the following sections, if the content is as simple as a few lines, put it in there, otherwise create separate files and refer to them from the sections.
