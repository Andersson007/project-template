# Contributor Guide

Welcome to the PROJECTNAME Contributor Guide!

> If your project is not going to have a docsite (for example, if it is very simple to contribute to it), the following information should be present in your project CONTRIBUTING.md file and referred to from the [README template](https://github.com/ansible-community/project-template/blob/main/README.md).

> In the following sections, if the content is as simple as a few lines, put it in there, otherwise create separate files and refer to them from the sections.

## Communication

Need help or want to share feedback? See the [Community guide](community_guide.md)!

## Project's place in the Ansible ecosystem

> Describe a project place in the Ansible ecosystem here. For example, the project can be a component of another project or serve as an auxiliary project.
In case the project is a standalone self-sufficient tool, this section can be omitted.

## Non-code contributions
